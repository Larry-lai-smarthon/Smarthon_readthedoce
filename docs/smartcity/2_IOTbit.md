# IoT:bit Introduction

## Introduction
Smarthon IoT Bit is an IoT orientated expansion board for Micro:bit. With the help of this, Micro:bit able to connect to different sensors or actuators without welding and start to use the internet services. 
<P>
It provides 13 regular GVS socket, allow user to connect batch of sensors at the same time to receive group of data. For some special purpose sensors/actuator, such distance sensor, motor and OLED display, an independent socket are offered, so not only the digital and analog I/O device can use in project, but also I2C device become an option to the Micro:bit from now on. Last but not least, a buzzer is built-in on the board to provide sound generation.
<P>
Several of wireless modules are compatible with the Smarthon IoT Bit, such Bluetooth and Wi-Fi modules. Beside of the commonly used Wi-Fi module ESP8266, the advanced version ESP32 is available to use on the IoT Bit too. After connect to internet, user able to enjoy the abundant internet resource to create the IoT project.

## Detail Hardware Description

<H3>Mirco:bit edge connecter</H3><BR>
![pic](images/2_IOT/iot_image04.png)
<P>Provide the socket for the Micro:bit to install. Follow the instruction icon right about that to install the Micro:bit to the expansion board.

<H3>Power port(USB, Battery, DC) & Switch</H3><BR>
![pic](images/2_IOT/iot_image05.png)
<P>Provide three different type of methods to power on the expansion board and Mirco:bit. User can either choose common 5V USB power, or two different port which connect to 3.7V ~ 6V battery box. 

<H3>OLED Module</H3>

![pic](images/2_IOT/iot_image06.png)
<P>The expansion board have the reserved space to place a SSD1306 0.96 inch OLED screen. User can use the I2C connection port to output the visual element on that module.

<H3>Wireless Module</H3><BR>
![pic](images/2_IOT/iot_image07.png)
<P>The Wireless Module provide the Core function of the expansion board. Though different modules install on the socket, Mirco:bit gain the correspond connectivity ability. User may install ESP32, ESP8266, Bluetooth to implement various application project, make use of the IoT resource.

<H3>ESP Servo port</H3><BR>
![pic](images/2_IOT/iot_image08.png)
<P>When installed the ESP32 module, it provide extra 3 servo control port to connect the Servo motor. Compatible with general GVS 180/360 Servo motor (SG90/SG90S)

<H3>Micro:bit lead out Pins</H3><BR>
