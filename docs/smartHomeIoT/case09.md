## Goal
<HR>

Make a digital clock that performs a normal clock function with auto-synchronizing time, and alert at specific time.<BR><P>

## Background
<HR>

<span id="subtitle">What is smart digital clock?</span><BR><P>
Smart digital clock is a clock that shows time as accurate as close to atomic clock by connecting to the Internet.<BR><P>
<span id="subtitle">Smart digital clock principle</span><BR><P>
NTP protocol ensures devices synchronize their time with an accurate time provider. With connecting to the Internet the digital clock can even show the time close to atomic clock in millisecond .<BR><P>

## Programming (MakeCode)
<HR>

<span id="subtitle">Step 1. Initialize OLED, IoT:bit and connect to WiFi, create the variable
* Snap `Initialize OLED with width 128, height 64` to `on start`
* Snap `Initialize IoT:bit TX P16 RX P8` to `on start`
* Snap `Set Wi-Fi to ssid pwd` to `on start` and enter the SSID and password
* Create the variable `alarmTrig`
* Set the `alarmTrig` variable to `false`

<span id="subtitle">Step 2. Check Wi-Fi connection state</span><BR><P>
* Snap the `On WiFi connected` block to editor
* Put a `show icon tick` inside the block to show tick icon after connected

<span id="subtitle">Step 3. Get the NTP time</span><BR><P>
* Put a `if` statement in `Forever`
* Use `WiFi connected?` as condition
* In `if` segment, put `Get NTP Current Time at city HongKong(UTC+8)` to get NTP time
* `Pause 500ms` to get the NTP time with each 0.5 second

<span id="subtitle">Step 4. Show the NTP time on display</span><BR><P>
* Put `On NTP received` to editor
* When get the NTP time, the program in this block will running
* Clear the display before each update by `Clear OLED display`
* Show the formatted time string with `show string join Date: day.Month.Year`
*  Show the formatted time string with `show string join Time: Hour:Minute:Second`

<span id="subtitle">Step 5. Set the alarm</span><BR><P>
* Put a `if` statement with multiple conditions `Hour = 6` and `Minute = 0` and `Second = 6`
* Put `set alarmTrig to true` in `if` segment
![auto_fit](images/Case9/Case9_p5.png)<P>

<span id="subtitle">Step 6. Set up the sound</span><BR><P>
* Put another `Forever` to editor
* Put a `if-else` statement inside the `Forever`
* Use `alarmTrig = true` as condition
* Play the alarm by melody at tempo 500 bpm
* Otherwise, stop the alarm

<span id="subtitle">Step 7. Turn off alarm</span><BR><P>
* Put `on Button A pressed` to editor
* Put `set alarmTrig to false` into the block

## Think
<HR>

Q1. Apart from showing the time and alarm, any other tasks can be done when we know the time?<BR><P>
