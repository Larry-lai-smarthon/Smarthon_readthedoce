# Introduction & Features

## Introduction
Smarthon IoT Bit is an IoT orientated expansion board for Micro:bit. With the help of this, Micro:bit able to connect to different sensors or actuators without welding and start to use the internet services.

It provides 13 regular GVS socket, allow user to connect batch of sensors at the same time to receive group of data. For some special purpose sensors/actuator, such distance sensor, motor and OLED display, an independent socket are offered, so not only the digital and analog I/O device can use in project, but also I2C device become an option to the Micro:bit from now on. Last but not least, a buzzer is built-in on the board to provide sound generation.

Several of wireless modules are compatible with the Smarthon IoT Bit, such Bluetooth and Wi-Fi modules. Beside of the commonly used Wi-Fi module ESP8266, the advanced version ESP32 is available to use on the IoT Bit too. After connect to internet, user able to enjoy the abundant internet resource to create the IoT project.
