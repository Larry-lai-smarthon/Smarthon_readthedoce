## Introduction
White LED module build in a high-performance LED for different usage, such illuminate, express program status, or make visual presentation. User just need to provide voltage, then can control the brightness by the corresponding input.
<P>


## The principle
The LED is a two-lead semiconductor light source. Under electroluminescence theory, when a suitable voltage is applied to the leads, electrons are able to release energy in the form of photons, which means emit of light. The color of light emitted depend on the energy level drop when doing electroluminescence, it is relative to material of the semiconductor.<P>
